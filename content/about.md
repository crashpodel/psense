Hey there!

Welcome to Product Sense.

Product sense is a blog about building better products of all. (Better = more useful, more beautiful, more successful for the people making them, more relevant to the users you serve)

It is written by Ashish Goel a.k.a. AG, as he was called in his job as the Head of Product Design at Zomato. I hold a Master's in Design from Stanford and I also did a year long teaching fellowship at Stanford d.school, which I taught design.

Since leaving Zomato, I've worked with founders of all shapes and sizes and scales.

Product sense is meant to be for all folks who are *not* designers. Over my time as a designer, I've learnt that design cannot be left to designers alone. 

Whether you are within an organization, everyone from the business owner, to the PM, to the developers play a big role in shaping the product, in fact, I'd say they play a bigger role than the designers. Developer asked me about a good book

Or perhaps you are budding founder, without the tools to get started.

Our focus is always the softer skills, not just tools.

For example, there is a big movement to go towards no-code tools, but you still need to build your intuition, a.k.a. your product sense to build the right product. This is what this blog is about.

### Why product sense?

My big belief is that mechanics matter less than the magic of product building.

here are the mechanics of product design and management
* running sprints
* the dogma of doing user research
* Epics stories and other product management paraphernelia
* The next cool tool

Here is the magic of product design
* craftsmanship
* that aha insight and whether that got you somewhere
* the burst of inspiration that made you want to sprint instead of being forced to sprint

Not that the mechanics does not matter, of course it does, but this is going to bias towards exploring the magic of product design
