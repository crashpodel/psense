You are in a bind. You are a new founder trying to figure out the UI for your app idea, a solo PM trying to flesh out a feature, or a developer about to embark on the indie lifestyle.

You need to wireframe. Stat. In the past, you have worked with a designer to help you out with mocks and wireframes, but this time you are on your own.

So you ask a few friends for advice on a wireframing tool and their answers fall in one of four buckets: 
- Pen & Paper
- Figma/Adobe XD/Sketch
- Some new kid on the block (Whimsical, Miro, etc.)
- Balsamiq

You’re stumped. You want to get started asap, but now you have to first spend time choosing a tool (Those new kids on the block must be doing something right...right?) 


Here’s my take: avoid wasting time looking for the perfect tool and just use Balsamiq. Here’s why.

## First, remember where wireframing fits in a product development workflow.
In the book *[The Elements of User Experience](http://example.com/ "Title")*, Jesse James Garett (the founder of Adaptive Path and the person who came up with the term AJAX) breaks down a user experience into 5 planes: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. 

Each plane of the user experience tackles a different question, and each question requires you to make something different  (something = a wireframe, or a mockup, or a PRD) to help answer that question well. 

Here’s are the five planes, the key question you are trying to answer at each and what you should make in response:

Wireframing is most helpful at the skeleton plane. That is, you know what needs and goals you are solving for (strategy), which features you are you are making (scope), a high level understand of how they are organized and how one navigates between your app (structure) and are ready to flesh out the individual screens of each feature, but are not yet concerned about the visual look and feel of your product (surface).

## A good wireframing tool lets you work quickly and gain clarity while keeping your options open.

Ryan Singer, the Head of Strategy at Basecamp, made the observation that problem-solving work goes from unknown to known and then from known to done. The unknown to known phase is the messy-figuring-shit-out-mode that will inevitably lead you down deadends, and generate ideas that eventually don’t make sense. 

Wireframing is an unknown to known activity and you will have to try out multiple layout ideas to see which one works best. You can’t just solve this in your head, you have to lay it out, see if it makes sense and then decide if you need to iterate or try something else.

This is why the ability to express your ideas quickly during the wireframing stage is important. When you do that, you can decide if the layout is right (get clarity), or try something else, that is, keep your options open.

Here is how Balsamiq supports these goals.

## Balsamiq comes with “batteries included.” 

As much as I love the feel of a felt-tipped pen on paper, re-drawing repeating elements (like a tab bar or a series of cards) gets frustrating after a point. 
As a wireframing-focused tool, Balsamiq can helps you work fast by giving you 
a) a extensive set of ready-made UI components that you can use to wireframe most interfaces.
b) a user interface that is all about surfacing these components and helping you use them. You can pick them through the tab menu menu on top, or (as I prefer) use the handy search bar.

Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD are powerful user interface design tools (and Figma deserves all the love it gets these days), but the truth is that wireframing is not a first-class use case in any of these tools. Their primary interface gives you basic shapes and primitives ike rectangles, circles and text. Yes, you can use them to make any kind of user interface component. But you don’t want to spend time have time for that?

And before you say the words UIKit or plug-in, don’t forget that that just means you now have to spend more time looking for the perfect UIKit. We are looking for progress, not perfection.

## Balsamiq lets you skip the details when you need to.

When you are still figuring out what the different screens of your app are, you don’t always know exactly what copy you are going to write or what interface element you are going to use. 
This is why I love Balsamiq’s placeholders components: “Block of Text”, “Line of Text” and “Image placeholder.”

By using these along with just a few other components, you can make rapid progress, And then when you are ready to detail things out further, you can go back and replace it with real content.

## Balsamiq allows for the right level of “suck.”
My hunch is that a lot of people don’t like Balsamiq because of the grayscale Comic Sans-iness of the results.  It sure looks a little ugly, especially if you’ve spend even a few minutes scrolling Dribbble. 
But that is a feature, not a bug. By constraining your design choices it kills the temptation to tweak the padding between elements, fiddling with colors and playing with typography during wireframing. 
Yes, you do need to figure out all of those things eventually, but wireframing is NOT that stage. Sure, it is possible for you to double-dip — make “high-fidelity” wireframes that solves for the skeleton plane and the surface plane simultaneously, but I don’t advise it, especially if you are new to wireframing.
You will end up spending a lot of time on just a few screens fine-tuning the visual details, instead covering more ground detailing the entire feature. Also, remember you want to gain clarity during wireframing, while keeping your options open. This helps is that it stops you from being too attached to one answer. 

## Balsamiq can handle polyamory. 
If you are feeling design tool FOMO, remember that just because you are using Balsamiq doesn’t mean you can’t use other tools!
For example, if you are solo founder, you can start with rough ideas on paper, write things out in Google docs, wireframe in Balsamiq, and then use a no-code tool to build your product (or hand off the document and the wireframes to an agency).
If you are a developer, you might like start by tinkering. So you start with coding a quick & dirty prototype code, explore specific interface ideas (not the whole app) with Balsamiq, and then design directly in the browser using something like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

One thing that might be a stumbling block for you is that Balsamiq isn’t free. 
What I like is that they sell a one-time purchase desktop version that does not need a subscription (Those monthly subscriptions add up, fast!). I’ve been using a version I got in in 2018 and it still works great. 

That’s it. Go forth and wireframe!
