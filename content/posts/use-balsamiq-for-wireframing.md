You are in a bind. You are a new founder trying to figure out the UI for your app idea, a solo PM trying to flesh out a feature, or a developer about to embark on the indie lifestyle.

You need to wireframe. Stat. In the past, you might have worked with a designer to help you with mocks and wireframes, but this time you are on your own. 

So you ask a few friends for advice on a wireframing tool and their answers fall in one of four buckets: 
- Pen & Paper
- Figma/Adobe XD/Sketch
- Some new kid on the block (Whimsical, Miro, etc.)
- Balsamiq

![Oh no, wireframing tool wanted](/what-to-wireframe-with-comic.jpg)



You’re stumped. You want to get started asap, but now you have to first spend time choosing a tool (Those new kids on the block must be doing something right...right?) 

Here’s my take: avoid wasting time looking for the perfect tool and just use Balsamiq. 

Here’s why.

## Understand where wireframing fits in a product development workflow.
In the book *[The Elements of User Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82y9Ygn28y0&t=52s "A video about Jesse James Garett's Elements of UX")*, Jesse James Garett (the founder of Adaptive Path and the person who came up with the term AJAX) breaks down a user experience into 5 planes: 

*Strategy*: What are your users' needs and business goals? 

*Scope*: What features are you going to build?

*Structure*: How do these features connect and support the user's journey?

*Skeleton*: What elements need to be on a screen or a page? and 

*Surface*: How do things look and feel? 

Since each plane of the user experience tackles a different question, at each stage you need to make something different  (something = a wireframe, or a mockup, or a PRD) to help answer that question well. 

Here’s are the five planes, the key question you are trying to answer at each and what you should make in response:

When you are wireframing, you are ready to flesh out the individual screens of each feature (skeleton), but are not yet concerned about the visual look and feel of your product (surface). 

## Since you are still figuring things out, a good wireframing tool lets you move quickly, gain clarity and keep your options open.

[Ryan Singer](https://twitter.com/rjs), the Head of Strategy at Basecamp, once made the observation that any problem-solving work goes from unknown to known and then from known to done. The unknown to known phase is the messy-figuring-shit-out-phase that will lead you down deadends and you will generate ideas that eventually don’t make sense. 

So it is with wireframing. You will try out multiple layout ideas to see which ones works best. 

This is why the ability to express your ideas quickly without getting mired in the details is important during wireframing. 

Any tool that lets you do that will be a great choice, and Balsamiq supports these out of the box.

## Balsamiq comes with “batteries included.” 

As a wireframing-focused tool, Balsamiq helps you work quickly by giving you 

a) a extensive set of ready-made UI components.

b) a user interface that is tailored towards helping your choose these components easily. You can pick them through the tab menu menu on top, or (as I prefer) use the handy search bar.

![Balamiq has UI components out of the box](/balsamiq-components.png)

As much as I love the feel of a felt-tipped pen on paper, re-drawing repeating elements (like a tab bar or a series of cards) gets frustrating after a point.

Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD are powerful user interface design tools (and Figma deserves all the love it gets these days), but the truth is that wireframing is not a first-class use case in any of these tools. 

The primary interface gives you basic shapes and primitives like rectangles, circles and text. Yes, you can use them to make any kind of user interface component, but who has the time to do that when wireframing? And before you say the words UIKit or plug-in, don’t forget that that just means you now have to spend more time looking for the perfect UIKit. 

We are looking for progress, not perfection.

## Balsamiq lets you skip the details when you need to.

When you are in the figuring out mode, you don’t always know exactly what copy you are going to write or what interface element you are going to use. 


This is why I love Balsamiq’s placeholders components: “Block of Text”, “Line of Text” and “Image placeholder.”

By using these along with just a few other components, you can make rapid progress, and when you are ready to detail things out further, you can go back and replace it with real content:

## Balsamiq allows for the right level of “suck.”
Yep, Balsamiq wireframes do look a little ugly. The hand-drawn component and the Comic-sans-y font might make you seek a prettier alternative.

But that is a feature, not a bug.

By limiting your design choices Balsamiq forces you to focus on solving layout questions, and not fiddle with colors or play with fonts. It also stops you from getting being too attached to one answer. 

Yes, you do need to figure out visual details eventually, but wireframing is NOT that stage. 

It is tempting to double-dip — make “high-fidelity” wireframes that solve for the skeleton plane and the surface plane simultaneously, but I don’t advise it, especially if you are new to wireframing.


## Balsamiq can handle polyamory. 
If you are feeling design tool FOMO, remember that just because you are using Balsamiq doesn’t mean you can’t use other tools!

For example, if you are solo founder, you can start with rough ideas on paper, detail things out in Google docs, wireframe in Balsamiq, and then use a no-code tool to build your product (or hand off the document and the wireframes to an agency).

If you are a developer, you might start by coding a quick & dirty prototype code, explore specific interface ideas (not the whole app) with Balsamiq, and then design directly in the browser using something like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

So there you have it. Go forth and wireframe!

*Sidenote*: Yep, Balsamiq isn’t free. 
What I like though is that Balsamiq has a desktop version that works without a monthly subscription (Those monthly subscriptions add up, fast!). I’ve been using a version I got back in 2018 and it still works great.
