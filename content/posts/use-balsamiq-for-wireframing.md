You are in a bind. You are a new founder trying to figure out the UI for your app idea, a solo PM trying to flesh out a feature, or a developer about to embark on the indie lifestyle.

You need to wireframe. Stat. In the past, you have worked with a designer to help you out with mocks and wireframes, but this time you are on your own. 

So you ask a few friends for advice on a wireframing tool and their answers fall in one of four buckets: 
- Pen & Paper
- Figma/Adobe XD/Sketch
- Some new kid on the block (Whimsical, Miro, etc.)
- Balsamiq

You’re stumped. You want to get started asap, but now you have to first spend time choosing a tool (Those new kids on the block must be doing something right...right?) 


Here’s my take: avoid wasting time looking for the perfect tool and just use Balsamiq. Here’s why.

## First, remember where wireframing fits in a product development workflow.
In the book *The Elements of User Experience*, Jesse James Garett (the founder of Adaptive Path and the person who came up with the term AJAX) breaks down a user experience into 5 planes: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. 

Each plane of the user experience tackles a different question, and each question requires you to make something different  (something = a wireframe, or a mockup, or a PRD) to help answer that question well. 

Here’s are the five planes, the key question you are trying to answer at each and what you should make in response:

Wireframing is most helpful at the skeleton plane. That is, you know what needs and goals you are solving for (strategy), which features you are you are making (scope), a high level understand of how they are organized and how one navigates between your app (structure) and are ready to flesh out the individual screens of each feature, but are not yet concerned about the visual look and feel of your product (surface).
