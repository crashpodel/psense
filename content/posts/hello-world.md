You have a problem. You are a founder trying to articulate the vision for your app, a PM trying to flesh out a feature, or a developer about to embark on the indie lifestyle.

You’ve heard that wireframing is a quick & dirty way to start figuring out the UX for your product, but with so many design tools, which one do you choose? 

A Google search give your nothing conclusive, so you go to a forum and ask: “What wireframing tool should I use?”

The answers fall in one of these four categories: 
* Pen & Paper
* Balsamiq
* Figma/XD/Sketch
* Some new kid on the block (Whimsical, Miro, etc.)

Now you've got more problems. It was already hard to choose, and now you have more choices (especially those new kids on the block, they must be doing something right. Right?) What to do?


I’m going to save you all the trial and error. Because you are not really asking for the best wireframing tool.  What you are really asking is this:

> ## *What is the fastest way I can articulate what is in my head without getting mired in the details?*

You are trying to find a tool that lets you move quickly, gain clarity and maintain flexibility.

And the answer to that question, is *just use Balsamiq*. I promise this isn’t paid for by Balsamiq.

Here are 4 reasons why you should (and 4 scenarios when you should not).

## Why use Balsamiq?

### 1) Balsamiq has a great set of ready-made UI components specifically designed for wireframing
User interfaces are made of components like buttons, form fields, containers, tab bars, text blocks and more. Many of these components get repeated across a website or app. Balsamiq gives you these components out of the box and it's interface is tailored to help you find these components quickly.

If you use pen and paper, you are going to be annoyed the fifth time you have to draw that tab bar.

Sketch, Figma or XD’s are very powerful mockup tools, and yes, that Dribble shot you saw last week looked pretty sweet, but wireframing is not a first-class use case in any of these tools. Their primitives in these tools are rectangles, circles and text. Yes, you can use these to make any kind of user interface. But do you really want to spend time making those components? 

You can get a wireframing plug-ins and or a wireframing UI kit from a site like UI8. Now you have to choose a wireframing kit. And then you have to learn the idiosyncracies of that kit. 

### 2) Balsamiq lets you skip the details when you need to
While you are still figuring out a product, you don’t always know exactly what content goes where, or even what the content is. Balsamiq gives you simple placeholder elements like an image placeholder or a block of text. You can get pretty far in terms of fleshing out an interface with these.

And then when you know more, you can go back and replace these elements with real content.

### 3) Balsamiq is at the right level of “suck”
I know some of you might hate the grayscale Comic Sans-iness of Balsamiq but it’s just what you need during wireframing.
The moment you start the tweaking the padding between elements, fiddling with colors and more, you will waste time. Yes, you need to figure out all of those things eventually, but wireframing is NOT that stage. 
If you are figuring out colors, padding, typography and more then you are no longer wireframing, you are making mockups (see below).

### 4) Balsamiq is a great fit within a suite of tools.
Using Balsamiq doesn’t mean you can’t use those other cool tools.

For example, if you are a founder, you can start on paper &rarr; move forward in Balsamiq &rarr;  finish in Figma (or get a designer’s help)

*Insert tool progression*

If you are a developer, you can start with a specifications document &rarr; flesh out the UI in Balsamiq &rarr; and then just develop it straight using something like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

## When not to use Balsamiq

### Don’t use Balsamiq if you are not *really* wireframing

In the book ['The Elements of User Experience'](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf), Jesse James Garett breaks down a user experience into 5 planes: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface. Wireframing works best at the Skeleton (and sometimes the Structure) planes.

Here's how to think about the right artifact for each plane:

#### Surface
*Key question:* What should my app look and feel like?  This is when you are figuring out colors, typography, imagery & styling.
*What to make?* A mockup.
#### Skeleton: 
*Key question* How should I organize the different elements on a page and across pages? 
*What to make?* A wireframe
#### Structure: 
*Key question* What are the different areas of my app or website? What screens are needed in each area (without getting into the contents of each screen)? How does one navigate between these areas and these screens? 
*What to make?* Make a flowchart.
#### Scope: 
*Key question* What features and functionalities do I need to build to solve for my users’ needs and business objectives? *What to make?* Write up a [PRD](https://medium.com/@uxpin/how-to-write-a-painless-product-requirements-document-508ff6807b4a)
#### Strategy: 
*Key question* 
What are my users’ needs? What are my business goals? 
*What to make?* Write a 2-pager or a memo (which is a synthesis of your vision or your point of view on the user need)

If you are worrying about colors and type, you are working on the surface. If you are still figuring out what your product is, perhaps writing things down is where you should start.

I am simplifying here a bit, and these planes aren't hard-edged phases. You can start at the surface and then go back to tweak the scope, or you can make an interactive prototype that cuts across planes (Balsamiq is also not the best tool for making clickable prototypes).

### Don’t use Balsamiq if the visual presentation matters
The designer Noel Franus, gave one of the best bits of advice about presenting work to a client, *“You don’t want it look like something that we pulled out of our ass last night.”*

*You* may be comfortable with the quick and dirty look of your wireframe, but if you are working for a client, or presenting to you manager or CEO, whom you know will cringe at the Comic Sans-yness of Balsamiq, then you need sexier wireframes.

### Don’t use Balsamiq if you already have an existing workflow with another tool
If you are a designer who is already used to working in Sketch / Figma / XD, it might be faster for you to work with a wireframing kit.

### Don't use Balsamiq if you are looking for a free tool
Yep, Balsamiq isn't free. Last I checked, the desktop version costs $89 with a free 30-day trial. But there is no monthly subscription fee. The desktop version is a one-time purchase that you can use for years.

There it is! Wireframe away.
